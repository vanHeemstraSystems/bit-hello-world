# 200 - Initialize a workspace

Initialize a workspace to start your journey into component-driven development. A workspace is a group of files and directories that provide the necessary context for components to be authored, composed, maintained, and collaborated on.

Run the following to create a workspace with a few components included, using the [hello-world starter](https://bit.cloud/teambit/community/starters/hello-world?_gl=1*b0egob*_ga*MTgyMjIxMzQ4MS4xNjkxMzk3MzQx*_ga_C0T2GH2G99*MTY5MTQwNjAxMi4yLjEuMTY5MTQwNzI3My41Mi4wLjA.):

```
$ bit new hello-world my-hello-world --env teambit.community/starters/hello-world
```

Open your workspace directory:

```
$ cd my-hello-world
```
