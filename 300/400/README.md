# 400 - Preview components

A Bit component is a reusable, independently source-controlled module, that is stored in [scopes](https://bit.dev/reference/scope/scope-overview) and maintained in [workspaces](https://bit.dev/reference/workspace/creating-workspaces). Bit components enable a new software development strategy that can be used to complement monorepos and poly-repos, or replace them, altogether.

Run the Workspace UI to preview your components:

```
$ bit start
```

The workspace UI displays all components maintained by your workspace. Use it to explore your components' [compositions](https://bit.dev/reference/compositions/compositions-overview), [documentation](https://bit.dev/reference/docs/docs-overview), [dependency graph](https://bit.dev/reference/dependencies/inspecting-dependencies), [version history](https://bit.dev/reference/components/navigating-history), and more.
