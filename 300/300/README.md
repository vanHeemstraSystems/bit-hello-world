# 300 - Run the app component

Your workspace maintains a number of components. One of these components is also an [app](https://bit.dev/reference/apps/application-types).

![image](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/bit-hello-world/assets/1499433/b2f491f0-5f72-43fc-bff1-77a07dc4a2f4)

Run the following to run the app component:

```
$ bit run hello-world-app
```

You will be asked to open your web browser to view the app. In case of using GitPod, the URL will be created from a temporary subdomain, like `
https://3000-vanheemstra-bithellowor-xesx3f3j5ey.ws-eu102.gitpod.io/`

The text on the web page is "Hello world!".

The terminal will respond with:

```
webpack 5.84.1 compiled successfully in 2863 ms
hello-world-app app is running on http://localhost:3000
```
