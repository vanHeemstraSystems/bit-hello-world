# 800 - Export changes to remote scopes

Export your [staged](https://bit.dev/reference/workspace/workspace-status#staged-components) components from your workspace to their remote scopes. This will make them available to be consumed by components outside of your workspace, as well as by traditional monolithic projects. More importantly, this will enable you to collaborate on individual components, independently.

```
$ bit export
```

Head to your [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud/?_gl=1*1890p6n*_ga*MTgyMjIxMzQ4MS4xNjkxMzk3MzQx*_ga_C0T2GH2G99*MTY5MTQwNjAxMi4yLjEuMTY5MTQwNzI3My41Mi4wLjA.) account to see your components in the remote scope.
